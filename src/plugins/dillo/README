Dillo Viewer: HTML mail viewing in Claws Mail
-------------------------------------------------

This plugin uses the Dillo (http://www.dillo.org) browser to
view text/html MIME parts inside Claws Mail.

When the plugin is loaded, if the MIME part to be viewed is of
text/html type, then the MIME part is saved in a temporary file and
Dillo is started with special options to embed it inside
Claws Mail' message view and to "safely" view the part.  Dillo is
also run in the fullwindow mode, where the toolbar, menubar and the
statusbar are hidden so the message is viewed in a larger area.  The
fullwindow mode is toggled on and off by double clicking on an empty
part of the page or by clicking on the icon in the lower right corner.

The "safe" viewing of text/html message parts is achieved by using the
-l (or --local) option of Dillo.  This option prevents Dillo from
retrieving remote web resources, like images.  Thus, no connection
to the Internet is done.  If the user wants to view the message
without this restriction, s/he just reloads the page by clicking on
the "Reload" button in Dillo's toolbar.

WARNING: This plugin is provided as is.  The author does not guarantee
safe viewing of text/html messages although he tried hard to achieve
this goal.

What Dillo version should be used?
----------------------------------

Dillo 0.7.0 was the first version that included the features needed by
Claws, but it had a small bug where remote resources could be
accessed even with the --local option (when a BASE element is present
in the message).

Since 2002-03-16, the CVS tree of Dillo fixed that bug.

Dillo 0.7.2 and newer (up to 3.0.5) do not have that bug, and are the
recommended versions to be used.

Acknowledgment:
---------------

The author of this plugin thanks the author of Dillo, Jorge Arellano
Cid, who accepted to integrate and improve the different patches
needed for this functionality.

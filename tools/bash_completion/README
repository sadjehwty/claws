Bash Programmable Completion for Claws Mail
-------------------------------------------

This directory contains a script which provides argument completion
when using Claws Mail from the command line under the bash shell.
This is usually triggered by pressing the tab key (â†¹).

See bash manual (https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/) for more
details about programmable completion.

Usage
-----

Examples below assume current directory is the toplevel directory of
either an extracted tarball or a git clone.

Single user
----------

For a single user just make a directory (e.g. '.bash_completion.d')
on your $HOME directory and copy the completion script there:

$ mkdir ~/.bash_completion.d
$ cp tools/bash_completion/claws-mail ~/.bash_completion.d/

Then, source the script to enable it:

$ . ~/.bash_completion.d/claws-mail

To enable it permanently just add the command to the user's bashrc:

$ echo '. ~/.bash_completion.d/claws-mail' >> $HOME/.bashrc

All users
---------

For system wide installation just copy the file to the system directory,
which is usually located in /etc (you need to become root for that):

$ sudo cp tools/bash_completion/claws-mail /etc/bash_completion.d/

After login in again all users should be able to use completion.
